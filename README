This is a collection of scripts and other miscellanea I've written.

smart-ad-pw-change.rb -- A Ruby script to get around Active Directory
  password history restrictions. As far as I can tell, AD has a finite prior
  history of previous passwords. So this script changes your password to
  a configurable number of random passwords and then back to your original
  password.

sort-media.rb -- A Ruby script to sort photos and videos, given a flat
  source directory, into photos and videos destination directories organized
  by year and month.
