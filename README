This is a collection of scripts and other miscellanea I've written.

smart-ad-pw-change.rb -- A Ruby script to get around Active Directory
  password history restrictions. As far as I can tell, AD has a finite prior
  history of previous passwords. So this script changes your password to
  a configurable number of random passwords and then back to your original
  password.
